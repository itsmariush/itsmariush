# From Idea to Reality: The Story of [Cloaked Shortener](https://cloaked.wikiapp.net)

*Unraveling the Journey of Creating a Hassle-Free Bookmarking Tool with Serverless and Rust*

**Introduction**

Have you ever found yourself in the middle of a browsing session in "Private Mode" and stumbled upon a fascinating link, only to hesitate to bookmark it? I've been there, too. That's why I set out on a journey to create [Cloaked Shortener](http://cloaked.wikiapp.net/), a nifty tool that makes bookmarking effortless and concealed. In this blog post, I'll take you through the journey of how I conceived the idea and turned it into a reality while also learning about serverless computing and [shuttle.rs](https://shuttle.rs).

**The Spark of Inspiration**

The story begins like many others: with a simple problem. I often found intriguing links while surfing the web privately but refrained from bookmarking them. I wondered, "Isn't there a way to bookmark these links without cluttering up my browser's bookmarks bar?" That's when the spark of inspiration struck.

**Conceiving the Idea**

I started by brainstorming a solution that would provide the convenience of bookmarking without the clutter. I envisioned a tool that would create short, concealed links, making it easy to store and access my favorite web addresses. The idea was to generate a Wikipedia summary containing the link, making it both functional and informative.

**Learning and Exploring Serverless**

In my quest to bring [Cloaked Shortener](https://cloaked.wikiapp.net) to life, I also wanted to expand my knowledge of serverless computing. I saw this project as the perfect opportunity to get hands-on experience with serverless architectures, which are known for their scalability and cost-effectiveness. I explored various serverless platforms and technologies to find the best fit for my project.

**Choosing [shuttle.rs](https://shuttle.rs) for the Backend**

As I delved deeper into the world of serverless, I came across [shuttle.rs](https://shuttle.rs), a serverless framework that allows developers to build and deploy serverless applications with Rust. Rust, known for its performance and safety features, seemed like an ideal choice for the backend of [Cloaked Shortener](https://cloaked.wikiapp.net). I embarked on the journey to learn and utilize [shuttle.rs](https://shuttle.rs) to power the backend of my project.

**The Planning Stage**

With the idea and technology stack in place, I began outlining the project. I jotted down the key features and functionalities I wanted to incorporate into [Cloaked Shortener](https://cloaked.wikiapp.net). This included a user-friendly interface, the ability to paste and shorten links, and the option to select a random article for added intrigue.

**Development Begins**

Next came the development phase. I rolled up my sleeves and started coding, both on the frontend and backend. For the backend, [shuttle.rs](https://shuttle.rs) allowed me to create a serverless Rust application that seamlessly integrated with the frontend. I incorporated modern web technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and libraries like Bulma, to create an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing user interface.

**Overcoming Challenges**

Every project has its fair share of challenges, and [Cloaked Shortener](https://cloaked.wikiapp.net) was no exception. I encountered issues related to API integration, user interface design, and cross-browser compatibility. However, each challenge served as a learning opportunity, pushing me to improve my coding skills and problem-solving abilities, especially in the context of serverless computing and Rust.

**Testing and Refinement**

As the project took shape, I rigorously tested [Cloaked Shortener](https://cloaked.wikiapp.net) to ensure a smooth user experience. I welcomed feedback from early testers, making necessary adjustments and refinements to enhance its functionality and usability.

**The Unveiling**

After weeks of hard work and dedication, I was ready to unveil [Cloaked Shortener](https://cloaked.wikiapp.net) to the world. I launched the website and shared it with friends and colleagues, eager to see their reactions.

**Future Plans**

While the initial release of [Cloaked Shortener](https://cloaked.wikiapp.net) fulfills its core purpose, I have big plans for its future. I'm actively working on enabling users to choose their own articles, providing even more customization and utility. Additionally, I'm excited to explore more serverless applications and Rust-based projects in the future.

**Conclusion**

The journey from idea to creation is filled with challenges, excitement, and the joy of bringing a concept to life. [Cloaked Shortener](https://cloaked.wikiapp.net) is the result of a simple problem that sparked an idea, and it now stands as a solution that simplifies the way we bookmark and access our favorite online destinations. It's also a testament to the power of serverless computing and the versatility of Rust through [shuttle.rs](https://shuttle.rs). I'm excited to see how it evolves and improves in the future, and I invite you to join me on this journey of innovation and convenience.

Thank you for being part of the [Cloaked Shortener](https://cloaked.wikiapp.net) story!
